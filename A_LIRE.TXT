If you compile the project, some files need to be copied to specific directories which are automatically created by the .deb package:

- The SQLite database `jardin.sqli` must be copied to the directory `/home/<your user name>/libreJardin/` on Linux.

- The example configuration files `jardin_exemple.xml` and `jardin_type.png` will also be copied to the same directory.
